### A very small ORM implementation

This project isn't trying to be a feature complete ORM implemenation at the moment.

We focus on the smallest parts that is required to quickly implement an project.

The core of this project is that the database is the master.

Features we support:
- Handle CRUD for entities using primary key

Features we will implement:
- Auto generate entities
- Return objects from select statements with joins

This project will be implemented fully open source and with as lean license as possible,
use our code just give us attribution and make note of your changes. We might need to change
the license later but at the moment we run with the Apache License because we want this code shared.
