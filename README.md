### A very small ORM implementation

This project isn't trying to be a feature complete ORM implemenation at the moment.

We focus on the creating a small implementation of the core features of ORM.
The core of this project is handling the database as the master.

Features we support:
- Handle CRUD for entities using primary key
- Generate entities

Features we will implement:
- Return objects from select statements with joins

This project will be implemented fully open source and with as lean license as possible,
use our code just give us attribution and make note of your changes. We might need to change
the license later but at the moment we run with the Apache License because we want this code shared.
